August 1st

Day 1 of Monk-Mode

Watched a hamza video about monk-mode:

Set some goals
Decided to stop doing all bad habits
Replaced bad habits with coding
Accepted that this journey wont be perfect, but everyday is a new opportunity

Coded for 2 hours

Learnt about css box models on freecodecamp.org by building a rothka painting
Made a post on github

Posting on github was my goal for the day so I am on track, but I've realized I’m not as locked in as I thought I quit my job on July 25th, to pursue coding, but since then I’ve only coded for 12 hours, I coded for 10 hours total in the 1st 2 days, but came across a project on freecodecamp.org that I couldn’t do perfectly and got discouraged, but I’m back now and I’m not stopping for nothing.

Watched some day trading videos to re familiarize myself with it since I took a break

I WANT IT ALL!!!
